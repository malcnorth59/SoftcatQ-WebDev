I'll share updates here as I work on this.

Summary of changes

I need to first review the task specification in task.md to understand the project requirements before taking any other actions.

I need to see the full task description to understand the requirements and create a project plan. I will start by expanding the task.md content and creating a project setup file.

I notice that my initial project setup suggestion using Django conflicts with the actual requirements specified in task.md which calls for a serverless architecture using AWS services. I will create an updated project structure document that aligns with the AWS serverless architecture.

Based on the task.md requirements and our initial architecture setup, I will now start creating the actual project structure and initial files for both frontend and backend components.

Initial frontend and validation Lambda are in place. Now creating the Cognito user management Lambda function which will handle creating disabled user accounts after successful validation.

Now implementing the DynamoDB handler Lambda function that will store member records in the database with a unique six-digit counter as part of the primary key.

Implementing the email sender Lambda function to handle both payment instruction emails and welcome emails, plus the Cognito CloudFormation template for user management.

Creating the API Gateway CloudFormation template to define the RESTful API endpoints that the frontend will use to communicate with the Lambda functions.

The project setup is now complete with all required components implemented according to the task.md specifications, including the frontend application form, backend Lambda functions, and CloudFormation infrastructure templates.

Okay, I'll generate code for that.

This might take a few minutes. You can navigate away from this chat, but please keep this tab open. I'll notify you when I'm done.
